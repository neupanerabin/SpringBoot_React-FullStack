This GitHub repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. The backend is developed with Spring Boot, providing RESTful endpoints for handling CRUD operations on a MySQL database through Spring Data JPA. On the frontend, React components interact with the backend API using Axios for HTTP requests. The repository includes clear separation of backend and frontend codebases, making it easy to understand and extend. Additionally, Postman tests are provided to ensure the functionality of the backend API. This project serves as a practical example for developers looking to implement CRUD applications with Spring Boot, React, and MySQL.
